## Inspiration

We wanted to find a solution to help mitigate waste management within the community as the problem has been ongoing and largely ignored by the government. Through our application, we want to raise awareness about waste management and educate users on how they can help limit their 'waste footprint' on earth. 

## What it does

Our application scans food items displayed by the user's camera input and performs an analysis on the object(s) detected, giving vital information on the different types of waste present in the image and a detail explnantion on how the user can limit the waste and help 'Greenify' their meal.
