# Greenify

The project is a waste management application that is capable of determining the waste components present in various food components and is thus able to give suggestions on how to mitigate wastage.

## Inspiration

We wanted to find a solution to help mitigate waste management within the community as the problem has been ongoing and largely ignored by the government. Through our application, we want to raise awareness about waste management and educate users on how they can help limit their 'waste footprint' on earth. 

## What it does

Our application scans food components displayed by the user's camera input and performs an analysis on the object(s) detected, giving vital information on the different types of waste present in the image and a detail explnantion on how the user can limit the waste and help 'Greenify' their meal.  

## Next Steps for Greenify

For improvement, we would like to include a point system within the program that is able to reward the user for the amount of waste they were able to reduce, with scaling being done based on algorithms that would be developed with the further implementation. This way, our application would both help inform users about their waste and also encourage users to take action to reduce their waste in order to earn points for the application.
